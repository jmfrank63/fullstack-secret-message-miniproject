Secret Message Mini Project for Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree

### This repo was my first try to use python on the cloud 9 platform
In this project your task is to decode a secret message with text hidden
in images with non corresponding names. The names are prepended by numbers
which you have to remove and then order the resulting filenames alphabetical.
